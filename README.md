# 'Taking Data Visualization to Another Level'

It is my first project with python. The main purpose is to learn new skills and check out what you can do with python from data science prospective. I've chosen to test out few libraries such as PANDAS, BOKEH, PLOTLY. 

### Project's Duration:
- Start: 26/04/2019
- End: 30/05/2019

## Before beginning

First of all, we need to install all Python packages for further work. As I mentioned before, I will be using few libraries to complete a project - PANDAS, BOKEH & PLOTLY.
The best way to install those packages through ANACONDA distribution. How to install ANACONDA you can find here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/. 
ANACONDA provides you a possibility to use CONDA. This is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. Now we are ready to install all packages and their dependencies for a project.

Once you've done this, you are ready to install pandas, bokeh and plotly. Just run script below:

 conda install pandas
 conda install bokeh
 conda install plotly

## First Visualization 'Top 10 shoe brands'

### Data

- Import data from website: [Node.js](https://data.world/datafiniti/womens-shoe-prices)

### Data Summary

This is a list of 10,000 women's shoes and their product information provided by Datafiniti's Product Database.
The dataset includes shoe name, brand, price, and more. Each shoe will have an entry for each price found for it and some shoes may have > multiple entries.
