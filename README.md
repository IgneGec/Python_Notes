# 'Taking Data Visualization to Another Level'

It is my first project with python. The main purpose is to learn new skills and check out what you can do with python from data science prospective. I've chosen to test out few libraries such as PANDAS, BOKEH, PLOTLY. 

### Project's Duration:
- Start: 26/04/2019
- End: 30/05/2019

## Before beginning

First of all, we need to install all Python packages for further work. As I mentioned before, I will be using few libraries to complete a project - PANDAS, BOKEH & PLOTLY.
The best way to install those packages through ANACONDA distribution. How to install ANACONDA you can find here: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/. 
ANACONDA provides you a possibility to use CONDA. This is an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local computer. Now we are ready to install all packages and their dependencies for a project.

Once you've done this, you are ready to install pandas, bokeh and plotly. Just run script below:

 conda install pandas
 conda install bokeh
 conda install plotly

## Some Hints
I used UPYTER NOTEBOOK to create visualizations. I believe this is the easiest way to get nice graphs.


## Visualizations

1. 'Top 10 shoe brands'
2. 'Population's distribution in USA'

## Last Steps

Both graphs are displayed on HTML and then deployed with surge.sh.
